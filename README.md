Sample space - S is a set of all possible outcomes of an experiment

Event Space - A subset of the sample space, some outcome that we care about 

Probability -> P(E) lim n -> infin n( E)/n

Axioms: 
1. 0 < P(E) < 1
2. Probability of sample set is 1
3. Probability E + Probability F = P ( E & F )
 
P E or F = P(E)+ P(F) - P ( E &F )
